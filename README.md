[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/nsls-ii/lmfit/_apis/build/status/NSLS-II.lmfit?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/nsls-ii/lmfit/_build/latest?definitionId=4&branchName=master)

This is the home page of **lmfit**,
a self-contained C library for Levenberg-Marquardt
least-squares minimization and curve fitting.


# Background information

## History

The core algorithm of lmfit has been invented by K Levenberg (1944) and D W Marquardt (1963).
The seminal FORTRAN implementation of MINPACK
is due to J M Moré, B S Garbow, and K E Hillstrom (1980).
An automatic translation into C was first published by S Moshier.
The present library lmfit started from a similar automatic translation.
With time, every single line was hand edited to convert the code into genuine, readable C.
The API was modified; examples, man pages, and build scripts were added.
Corrections and refinements were contributed by users (see CHANGELOG).

## Mathematics

For a gentle introduction to the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm,

## Citation

When using lmfit as a tool in scientific work, no acknowledgement is needed:
If fit results are robust, it does not matter by which software they have been obtained.
If results are not robust, they should not be published anyway.
In methodological publications, e g when describing software that interacts with lmfit,
the preferred form of citation is:

# FAQ

## How to constrain parameters?

In many applications, it is desirable to impose constraints like p0>=0 or 10<p1<10.

In lmfit, there is no explicit for mechanism for this, and it is unlikely that I will ever add one: In my experience, it is sufficient to mimick constraints by variable transform or by adding a penalty to the sum of squares. Variable transform seems to be the better solution.

In the above examples: To enforce p0'>0, use e.g. p0'=exp(p0) or p0'=p0^2. To enforce -10<p1'<10, use p1'=10*tanh(p1).

## How to weigh data points?

In least-squares curve fitting, data points _y_(_x_) are approximated by function values _f_(_x_;**p**). Sometimes, one wants to assign data points a weight _w_(_x_). One then has to minimize the sum of squares of _w_*(_y_-_f_).

### How to implement

This can be implemented easily by copying _lmcurve.h_ and _lmcurve.c_, and modifying them in obvious ways, just introducing a new parameter _w_.

### How to choose weights

Assuming that data points _y_(_x_) follow Gaussian distributions with standard deviations _dy_(_x_), the appropriate weight is _w_(_x_) = 1 / _dy_(_x_).

### How to deal with Poisson-distributed data

Least-squares fitting is not justified for Poisson-distributed data -- except if the data are large enough (say, on average _y_ of the order of 10 or larger) so that the Poisson distribution is reasonably well approximated by a Gaussian with standard deviation _dy_=sqrt(_y_). When experimental data have on average too low values _y_ per channel, they should be binned into fewer channels with better statistics before any least-squares fitting.
